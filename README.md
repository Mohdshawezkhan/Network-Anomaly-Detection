# Network-Anomaly-Detection

# Overview
This project aims to develop a network anomaly detection system using machine learning techniques. The system will monitor network traffic data and identify unusual patterns or behaviors that could indicate potential security threats or operational issues.

# Requirements
Python 3.<br />
NumPy<br />
Pandas<br />
Scikit-learn<br />
Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation)<br />

Dataset The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anushonkar/network-anamoly-detection
Please download the dataset and place it in the data directory before running the code.
